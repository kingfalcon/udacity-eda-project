# udacity-eda-project
This repo was created to house my work for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program. In this project, I used R to conduct an exploratory analysis of more than 100,000 Prosper loans with 80+ features each. 


This repo includes the following files: 
- **README.md:** This file, which contains a summary of files used for this project
- **EDA_Project_M_Long.rmd:** The final R Markdown file containing my data exploration process and findings
- **EDA_Project_M_Long.html:** The final knitted R Markdown file containing my data exploration process and findings


Additionally, during the course of completing this project, I consulted the following sources:
- The Udacity Exporatory Data Analysis course
- Stack Overflow
- Rstudio.com
- Minimaxir.com
